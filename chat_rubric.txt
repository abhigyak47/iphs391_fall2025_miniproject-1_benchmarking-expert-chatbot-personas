Persona Quality Rubric — chat_rubric.txt
=================================================
Version: 1.0
Use: Academic evaluation + student self-assessment of chatbot persona quality for multi-turn conversations (≥10 turns).

TOTAL SCORE (0–100)
-------------------
Total = 0.20·Consistency + 0.10·Depth + 0.25·Authenticity + 0.15·Creativity + 0.30·Engagement

Weights
- w1 Consistency = 20%
- w2 Depth       = 10%
- w3 Authenticity= 25%
- w4 Creativity  = 15%
- w5 Engagement  = 30%

General Instructions
--------------------
1) Read the persona prompt and the full dialogue (at least 10 turns) once without scoring.
2) Read again and mark evidence for each factor (quotes, turn numbers).
3) Score each factor 0–100 using the bands below. Be specific; avoid halo effects.
4) Compute the weighted total with the formula above.
5) Write 2–4 strengths and 2–4 improvements that map directly to factors.

FACTOR 1 — CONSISTENCY (20%)
----------------------------
What to measure (works for any persona):
- Voice & Mannerisms: Stable tone/diction that match the persona brief (e.g., clinician, detective, coach).
- Cognitive Boundaries: Adheres to knowledge/tools/ethics constraints; states uncertainty when appropriate.
- Behavioral Commitments: Persona “rituals” or style rules (e.g., always offers checklist first) are followed across turns.
- Instruction Hierarchy: Persona/safety rules override casual user nudges.

Scoring bands:
- 90–100: No lapses; voice + rules steady across all/most turns.
- 75–89: 1–2 minor slips; overall steady persona.
- 60–74: Several generic or out-of-character patches; persona still recognizable.
- 40–59: Frequent breaks in voice or rules.
- <40: Largely not in character.

FACTOR 2 — DEPTH (10%)
----------------------
What to measure:
- Substance: Accurate domain facts, procedures, or frameworks beyond surface-level gloss.
- Actionability: Concrete steps, parameters, scripts, code, or examples the user can execute.
- Nuance: Trade-offs, edge cases, failure modes; realistic time/cost ranges.

Scoring bands:
- 90–100: Highly actionable, domain-savvy, and realistic.
- 75–89: Strong detail with occasional thin spots.
- 60–74: Mixed depth—some concrete tips, some hand-wavy parts.
- 40–59: Mostly generalities; limited practical value.
- <40: Superficial.

FACTOR 3 — AUTHENTICITY (25%)
-----------------------------
What to measure:
- Believability: Responses align with persona’s biography/locale/expertise/values.
- Embodied Detail: Specific sensory/procedural/jargon details a real expert/character would know.
- Internal Coherence: No contradictions with earlier self-claims; avoids “generic AI narrator.”

Scoring bands:
- 90–100: Feels like a real person/expert; rich, specific detail supports guidance.
- 75–89: Several authentic touches; a few generic phrases.
- 60–74: Some authentic color, but often generic.
- 40–59: Rare/ornamental authenticity; thin texture.
- <40: Vague/boilerplate; breaks the illusion.

FACTOR 4 — CREATIVITY (15%)
---------------------------
What to measure:
- Inventive Framing: Fresh analogies, structures, or narratives that fit the persona.
- Appropriate Divergence: Novel but on-brief suggestions (alternate solution paths, creative options).
- Constraint-Aware Flair: Originality without breaking safety/accuracy.

Scoring bands:
- 90–100: Original, memorable touches that elevate usefulness and stay on-brief.
- 75–89: Some creative flourishes; generally conventional.
- 60–74: Occasional novelty; mostly template-like.
- 40–59: Flat or off-brief attempts at novelty.
- <40: Little creativity or derailing “randomness.”

FACTOR 5 — ENGAGEMENT (30%)
---------------------------
What to measure:
- Dialogue Management: Early clarifying/discovery questions; revisits constraints; adapts to evolving goals.
- Pedagogy/Coaching: Teaches small, timely skills (heuristics, checklists, examples) tailored to the moment.
- Follow-Through: Answers multi-part questions thoroughly; offers next steps/alternatives; maintains momentum.
- Affect: Warmth or appropriate persona affect that invites further interaction.

Scoring bands:
- 90–100: Highly interactive; anticipates needs; teaches proactively; excellent follow-ups.
- 75–89: Engaging with a few missed teachable moments or sub-questions.
- 60–74: Adequate; some missed opportunities; occasional one-shot replies.
- 40–59: Minimal engagement; limited adaptation.
- <40: Transactional; poor multi-turn awareness.

Adaptation Notes (to fit any persona)
-------------------------------------
- Replace persona-specific “rituals” in Consistency with the new persona’s required behaviors (e.g., cites papers; begins with a differential diagnosis; uses nautical metaphors; never uses emojis).
- Depth indicators are domain-agnostic: for coding tutor—runnable snippets + tests; for therapist—structured, ethical interventions and boundaries; for analyst—assumptions + scenarios + sensitivity.
- Authenticity demands concrete, plausible details consistent with the claimed background (correct jargon, locale-specific references, professional ethics).
- Creativity should serve the user goal and persona constraints; penalize novelty that harms accuracy or tone.
- Engagement is universal: discovery questions, multi-part handling, pedagogy, and clear next steps.
